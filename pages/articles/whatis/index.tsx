          <p>
            ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art AI-driven natural language processing
            tool that facilitates human-like conversations. Leveraging
            sophisticated algorithms and a vast database, ChatGPT can assist
            users in diverse tasks ranging from answering queries to aiding in
            content creation like emails, essays, and even coding.

            **How to use ChatGPT: What you need to know now**
            <br />
            <br />
            1. **Interactivity**: Engage with ChatGPT just like you would with
            another human. Type your questions or statements, and the system
            will provide responses in real-time. 2. **Versatility**: ChatGPT can
            be employed for a wide array of tasks. Whether it's fact-checking,
            brainstorming ideas, or even learning a new subject, ChatGPT is here
            to assist. 3. **Limitations**: While highly advanced, ChatGPT is
            still a machine. It operates based on the data it has been trained
            on. Always validate important information from trusted sources. 4.
            **Pricing**: While the basic version is accessible to the public at
            no charge, the premium version, ChatGPT Plus, comes with a
            subscription fee. It often offers enhanced features and faster
            response times.
